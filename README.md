# spine-html

Render [Spine](https://esotericsoftware.com/) skeletal animations as **plain DOM** — one
absolutely-positioned `<img>` per slot, posed with a single CSS `matrix()` write per frame.
No canvas, no WebGL for the rigid tier.

## Why

Every Spine web runtime rasterizes into a canvas. But `spine-core` is fully
renderer-independent: it computes bone world transforms — and even deformed mesh
vertices — on the CPU. For **region attachments** (the rigid parts of a skeleton), a bone
transform is a plain affine map, and CSS `transform: matrix()` expresses that *exactly*.
So the rigid tier of a Spine skeleton can live in the DOM, composited by the browser,
inspectable in devtools, styled with CSS.

The idea has been floated on the official forum three times since 2014 and was never
built — the blockers named were meshes, clipping, and DOM update overhead. This project
is the experiment: how far does the DOM actually go, and how cheap is it?

Measured so far (PoC, Chromium on Apple silicon):

- Rigid only (spineboy-ess): 10 skeletons / 180 slot images at **~0.03 ms skeleton math
  + ~0.22 ms DOM writes per frame** — about 1.5% of a 60 fps frame budget.
- With meshes (spineboy-pro): 1 skeleton = **~0.05 ms + ~0.5 ms render** (8 mesh
  canvases, 323 triangles); 10 running skeletons = **~4.4 ms/frame** total.

## Status

**Proof of concept.**

- ✅ Region attachments (rigid parts): exact affine mapping, draw-order via `z-index`,
  attachment swaps, alpha
- ✅ Atlas unpacking at load time (90°-packed regions restored), so the rigid per-frame
  path never touches a canvas
- ✅ Mesh attachments (deform tier): small per-part canvases sized to the mesh's world
  bounds, interleaved with the rigid `<img>` slots in one stacking context — the DOM
  handles the bones, a rasterizer handles the warps
- ✅ Blend modes via `mix-blend-mode` (additive = `plus-lighter`)
- ⬜ Clipping — deliberately unsupported (counted and skipped); layered transparent
  parts + `overflow: hidden` cover the practical cases
- ⬜ RGB tinting (alpha works); DPR-aware mesh canvas backing store

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
bun run fetch-assets   # downloads the official spineboy example (not redistributed here)
bun run dev
```

## How it works

1. `@esotericsoftware/spine-core` loads the skeleton and drives `AnimationState`,
   constraints, and physics — all CPU-side, renderer-agnostic.
2. At load time each atlas region is cut into its own bitmap (rotation restored), one
   blob URL per region.
3. Per frame, for each slot in draw order: `computeWorldVertices` yields the region's
   four corners in world space (order **BL, UL, UR, BR** — note the comments inside
   `computeWorldVertices` are stale). Flip Y (Spine is Y-up), derive the affine from
   three corners, write one `matrix()` string. That's the whole render path.
